# AWSMinecraft - An easy way to run Minecraft on AWS

Hello! This project is meant to be a lesson in how to learn AWS (for myself) and to help anyone out that might want to try AWS as a cloud-based server option when playing Minecraft.

CloudFormation template was taken off the standard AWS webssite, and re-purposed for this project.

This uses Multicraft to administrate the site. Since minecraft can't be scaled out (possibly) this will only create one server that you can use to administer and play mincraft on.
