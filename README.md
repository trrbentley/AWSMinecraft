# AWSMinecraft - An easy way to run Minecraft on AWS

Hello! This project is meant to be a lesson in how to learn AWS (for myself) and to help anyone out that might want to try AWS as a cloud-based server option when playing Minecraft.

CloudFormation template was taken off the standard AWS website, and re-purposed for this project. This is still a work in progress... so feel free to use what I have.

This uses Multicraft to administrate the site. Since minecraft can't be scaled out (possibly) this will only create one server that you can use to administer and play mincraft on.

NOTE: If you want a quick way to create a minecraft server, you can always use the 'minecraftstartup.sh' script in your EC2 startup to quickly create a server. (make sure to have the appropriate ports and whatnot available!)
